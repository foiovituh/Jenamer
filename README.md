# :file_folder: Jenamer
Mass File Renamer developed in Java 17!

![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68431603/163689280-baca9f6e-e81d-4e03-a2f7-e4a13d8af086.gif)

## :pushpin: Objective
Solve the following situation: you have a directory with MANY disorganized files, how much time/effort would it take to rename them one by one? Jenamer renames all files based on a template name + separator + index.

:dart: Open:
- rename directories
- make separator optional
- allow setting the index position
- create a web(quarkus)/window(swing) version

## :link: Requirements
- Java 17+
- Windows/Linux
- Terminal (console)

### :gear: Arguments

- First argument: full path to the target directory (if there are spaces you must enclose them in quotes)
- Second argument: template name, example -> "file"
- Third argument: index separator, example -> "-"

### :busts_in_silhouette: Do you want help me?
